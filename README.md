#Viking Funbotics Tutorial

Hey you campers! You're going to be programming robots!

Compile using:
`make FFILE=basename` where your file is `basename.c`

####Some basic stuff:
1. `Forward(1);`
    * You just made the robot go forward for one second!
2. `blink(1, 2);`
    * You just made the light on pin one blink on and off with two second intervals!
